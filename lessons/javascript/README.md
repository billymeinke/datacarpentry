title: Data Processing with Javascript
---

In the bad old days of the web, static pages ruled, with 
content being very text-heavy and non-interactive.
Furthermore, any updates to any section of a page required 
a full page reload. This made the experience a very 
long-winded and slow affair.

Then Javascript came along and after a pretty shaky few years
became almost everywhere on the web, powering and enhancing 
websites to give users a more interactive experience when 
viewing web content.

In these lessons, we'll learn about how to use Javascript to 
grab, process and visualise data on a webpage.
